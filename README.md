# coven ðŸ§™âœ¨ðŸ”®

An occult chat app using [Cabal](https://cabal.chat/)

![An AI-generated image of the prompt "Watercolor drawing of a witch hat, glowing over a plain background."](https://i.imgur.com/jPwXOZrm.png)

Uses the [cable.rs](https://github.com/cabal-club/cable.rs) implementation of the new [Cable protocol](https://github.com/cabal-club/cable).

For now is a desktop app, but with the magic of [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) may also become a mobile app, a web app, and a terminal app.

**Status**: Pre-Alpha (Work in progress, expect changes)

## Usage

cd coven
curl 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@3.9.4/dist/full.css' > 'public/daisyui.css'

```
